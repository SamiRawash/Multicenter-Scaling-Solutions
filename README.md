# Multicenter-Scaling-Solutions
Optimization algorithm to find approximate solutions to the bubble equations in the scaling regime. The main file is EA_algorithm.py. The number of centers is controlled by the parameter :nn: in parameters.py. A pre-print with a detailed explaination of the code and results will be published soon.
